Hey there!

This bot informs you of new listings on the Homegate platform at the start of every hour. To start, configure your search parameters. You can do this with six commands:

/min_price 1500 - Sets the minimum price to 1500 CHF.
/max_price 3800 - Sets the maximum price to 2800 CHF.
/min_rooms 3 - Sets the minimum number of rooms to 3.
/max_rooms 5 - Sets the maximum number of rooms to 5.
/min_space 95 - Sets the minimum floor space to 95 square meters.
/max_space 150 - Sets the maximum floor space to 150 square meters.

To define the areas where you want to search in, use the /add_area and /remove_area commands like this:

/add_area zurich - Searches for areas matching "zurich" and allows search results to be added to the list of included areas.
/remove_area - Prompts for an area to be removed from the list of included areas.

You will only receive search results when you add some areas, so make sure to run /add_area.
